# Authentication Architecture Update Plan

## Current Issues
1. Route protection logic split between AuthContext and withAuth
2. Duplicate loading state handling
3. Undocumented Authorization singleton pattern
4. Implementation diverged from documented architecture

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Consolidate Route Protection
- Move all route protection logic to withAuth HOC
- AuthContext should only manage auth state
- Update AuthContext to provide simpler interface

### 2. Loading State Management
- Create unified loading state in AuthContext
- Remove duplicate loading states
- Add loading state types to AuthContextType

### 3. Authorization Singleton
- Document Authorization singleton pattern
- Add to architecture documentation
- Include usage examples

### 4. Architecture Documentation Updates
- Update AUTH-ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect current implementation
- Add new sections for:
  - Authorization singleton
  - Loading state management
  - Route protection patterns

### 5. Implementation Plan
1. Refactor AuthContext to simplify interface
2. Move route protection logic to withAuth
3. Update loading state management
4. Document Authorization singleton
5. Update architecture documentation

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (1 day): Refactor AuthContext and withAuth
- Phase 2 (1 day): Update loading state management
- Phase 3 (1 day): Document Authorization singleton
- Phase 4 (1 day): Update architecture documentation

## Testing Strategy
- Update unit tests for AuthContext
- Add integration tests for route protection
- Verify loading state behavior
- Test Authorization singleton usage
