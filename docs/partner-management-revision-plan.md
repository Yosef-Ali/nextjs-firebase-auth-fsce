# Partner Management Revision Plan

## Background
In the partner management section, the following issues were identified:
- Some columns may be missing.
- A component appears to be duplicated in the partners list.

## Current Implementation
- The table defined in `columns.tsx` displays: Order, Logo, Name, Partner Type, Website, and Actions.
- The `CellAction` component handles row actions.
- The `client.tsx` component is open and might be causing duplicate rendering.

## Proposed Revisions
1. Confirm that the partner table displays only the necessary columns:
   - Order
   - Logo
   - Name
   - Partner Type
   - Website
   - Actions
2. Investigate the `client.tsx` component to determine if its functionality overlaps with other components.
3. Remove any redundant or duplicate component usage to prevent duplicate rendering.
4. Test the partner management view to ensure that data is loaded and displayed only once.

## Next Steps
- Review the usage of `client.tsx` and refactor or remove it if found redundant.
- Validate the partner list display for any duplicate components.
- Ensure the UI follows best practices and maintains clarity.

## Conclusion
This plan aims to streamline the partner management interface by ensuring only necessary columns are shown and eliminating any duplicated component rendering.
